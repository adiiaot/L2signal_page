    q: 'Disclaimer — Is L2 Signals an investment service? Do you manage funds?',
    a: 'No. L2 Signals is not a financial investment service and we do not manage or trade funds for anyone unless there is a signed agreement. We do not offer investment advice or take users money to trade. Users only pay for signal access in the private Telegram group and access to features in the upcoming web app as the business scales. Trade your own account, manage your own risk.',
    highlight: true,
  },
  {
    q: 'What is L2 Signals and how does it work?',
    a: 'L2 Signals is a systematic XAU/USD intraday product built for disciplined retail traders. It uses three complementary strategies that each handle a different market regime and hybrid pending orders — limit + stop with the same SL/TP, whichever touches first fills and the other is cancelled — to 21:00 UTC close. The system is deterministic: same rules every time, no discretion, no chasing. Backtested on real Dukascopy spot gold and forward validated live, with every trade, R and date logged.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need trading experience to use it?',
    a: 'Yes, basic experience is needed. You should understand stop loss, take profit, lot sizing and risk per trade (we use 1–2% per trade). L2 provides the system, the entry/SL/TP, the exit playbook (50% at +1R to breakeven, rest to TP) and the ledger. You execute on your own broker or prop firm. If you are new, paper trade first and follow the free channel to learn the workflow before paying for private access.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How are signals delivered?',
    a: 'Signals and daily results are posted in the free public channel for transparency. Paid members get private Telegram access for intraday signals when the private group launches, and later the upcoming web app will mirror the same signals with additional tooling. No email list is needed — the Telegram channel is the waitlist and update channel.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why hybrid limit + stop entries?',
    a: 'Gold often either retraces to a good limit or runs away without retracing. Every L2 signal ships both: a limit order at the ideal price and a stop fallback behind the entry with the same stop loss and take profit. Whichever level touches first fills and we cancel the other. If price is already past both at generation, it becomes a market order. This cuts missed moves while keeping risk fixed at 1–2% per trade.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can I verify the results are real?',
    a: 'The demo milestone — $100 to $1,007.41 in 37 days — is documented trade by trade on X with links in the Demo ledger, and the full trade history is verifiable there and in the Telegram channel. Live prop trades are verified privately with screenshots and account statements, and published after the challenge is completed to avoid copy-trading from others using the same firm. The ledger on this site is the single source of truth and updates as new trades are logged.',
  },
  {
    q: 'When will the web app and private group launch?',
    a: 'Timing depends on demand and validation. The free Telegram channel is the waitlist — when we see consistent demand and the live forward validation holds, we open the private Telegram for paid signals and then the multi-user web app with auth, subscriptions and tooling. Join the channel now to be first to know; no deposit or pre-payment is taken before launch.',
